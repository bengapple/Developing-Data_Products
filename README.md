#Offenders Executed  by Texas Department of Criminal Justice 



The Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) manages offenders in state prisons, state jails and private correctional facilities that contract with TDCJ. The agency also provides funding and certain oversight of community supervision (previously known as adult probation) and is responsible for the supervision of offenders released from prison on parole or mandatory supervision.

On the darker side the TDCJ keeps a database of all offenders executed by the state.  This application makes use of the executed offenders database.  For those that are interested that data can be found at: http://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html.

The application can be run at: http://bengapple.shinyapps.io/TexasDRow
